## Requirements

* A deck of 23 trick cards.
* A deck of 15 special cards.
* A 6-sided die per player.
* A bunch of letter tokens.

## Objective

Make your opponents receive all the letters; i.e. S, K, A, T and E.

## Rules

### Set up

All tricks and specials are shuffled and put into a deck each. All the letter tokens are put into a pile next to the decks.

Each player draws 3 cards from the top of the trick deck and 1 from the specials deck. Players do not reveal their hands.

Players determine who gets to start by throwing down in a battle of Rock, Paper or Scissors.

### Setting a trick

At the start of each turn, if the player has 3 cards or less, he draws cards from the top of the trick deck until he has 4 cards in hand, and must then put a trick card into play.

Once a trick has been played, the player must roll a die and finish with a roll equal to, or higher than, the difficulty of the trick to successfully set it.

If the player does not succeed in setting the trick, the player loses his turn and the turn is immediately passed on to the next player, who then tries to set a trick.

### Matching it

Once a trick has been set, each opposing player take turns at attempting to match it (by playing the same trick card and rolling a die).

If they don't succeed, they receive a letter.

A player might not be able to match the trick with their current hand, but can instead opt for discarding a trick card to get the chance to match it by rolling a die twice. Both rolls must match the difficulty of the played trick to successfully match it.

A player is out of the game when they have gained all letters (i.e. S, K, A, T and E). The game ends when there's only one victorious player left.

### Repeating

Once each player have had their chance to match the trick, the game continues, and the player who previously set a trick gets to set another one.

This process repeats until the player fails in setting a trick, and the turn then moves on to the next player in line.

At the end of each turn, players put their played cards into their respective discard piles (tricks and specials).

If the trick or specials deck is emptied, the discarded cards are shuffled and replaces the respective deck.

### Specials

Certain cards allow players to intervene on another player's turn. These cards can be played at any time.

#### How to get them

Whenever a player rolls a 1 (i.e. the lowest and most unlucky roll of all), they get to draw a card from the pile of special cards.

#### Playing them

Playing a special card does not require anything unless stated otherwise. They can be played at any time, even when it's not the player's turn.

Similarly, there is no restriction on how many special cards can be held or played at once.

When a special card has been used, it is put back into the pile and the pile gets shuffled.

## Tricks

Each trick requires a single dice roll unless stated otherwise. The roll must be equal to, or higher than, the difficulty of the trick.
